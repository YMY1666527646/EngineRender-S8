**This is old deviant source,**

**I've updated it fully but I am not leaking the fully updated source because I don't want to deal with the amount of p2c's..**

**What you need to do and what i've done for you: I have updated Postrender..You need to update GoObjects (sig), Lineofsight (sig,offset)....and sdk currently It has 16.00 and not 18.00. Also maybe keystates but who knows**

*If you manage all of that you have a fully working internal source with working rapid fire, no spread, and FOV Changer, Also the fact that It's enginerender so you can look extra cool*


SDK: Unrealdumper üêí
